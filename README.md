# Data Structures in Kotlin

[![License MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)]

# Introduction

Welcome to a work in progress. No more interviewing in Java for Kotlin jobs! 

Data Structures are fundamentals in Computer Science and can be key to understanding the nuances of a particular language. 
In Kotlin, there are libraries to support data structures, but few sources for implementing data structures from scratch.

# Getting started

You should be familiar with
basic programming (functions, loops, variables, data types, etc), object oriented programming(classes, polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation), 
and getting a development environment running.

All structures should be as simple and generic as possible. Complexity and
patterns should only be introduced when they are needed for practicality.

# Directory Structure

Inside the src folder there will be a main testing class, and then the following folder structure:
- algorithms
- data structures
- Interview questions
    - Arrays and Strings
    - Linked Lists
    - Stacks and Queues
    - Trees and Graphs
    - Bit Manipulation
    - Brain Teasers
    - Mathematics and Probability
    - Object-Oriented Design
    - Recursion and Dynamic Programming
    - Scalability and Memory Limits
    - Sorting and Searching
    - Testing
    - Knowledge Based: Kotlin Specific Questions
    - Concurrency, Threading and Locks
    - Other: Moderate to Difficult problems

# How to contribute

If you are willing to contribute to the project, feel free to begin, but let me know your plans with a github private message.
Interview Q&A's that require data structures should utilize the native Kotlin libraries rather than the data structures featured in this project.
